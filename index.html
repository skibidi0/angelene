        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <img src="d:\Mangiliman_CET102\Horoscope\Benefits-of-Cloud-Computing-2.png" alt="benefits" id="image-right">
        <li><b>High Speed - Quick Deployment</b></li>
        <p>The ability to spin up a new cloud computing instances in a matter of seconds reshaped the agility and speed
            of software development.</p>
        <li><b>Scalability</b></li>
        <p>This scalability minimizes the risks associated with in-house operational issues and maintenance.</p>
        <li><b>Effiency and Cost Reduction</b></li>
        <p>By using cloud infrastructure, you don't have to spen dhuge amounts of money on purchasing and maintaining
            equipment. You don't have to invest in hardware, facilities, utilities, or building out a large data center
            to grow your business.</p>
        <li><b>Business continuity</b></li>
        <p>In the event of disaster or unforeseen circumstances, do you have an effective backup plan? If not, relying
            on cloud computing services can benefit your organization. Cloud computing uses infinite data storage space
            and systems that can be activated remotely if necessary to ensure business continuity.</p>
        <li><b>Instant business insights</b></li>
        <p>Cloud-based platforms provide a unique opportunity to access data as soon as it’s collected. This facilitates
            better decision-making as well as insight into what the future may hold for your organization based on
            predictions from historical data.</p>
        <li><b>Higher performance and availability</b></li>
        <p>By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously, you reap greater performance gains than by having
            your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing increases input/output operations per second (IOPS).</p>
        <li><b>Virtualized computing</b></li>
        <p>Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer environments because cloud resources can be allocated
            instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never experience downtime again. With cloud
            computing, your business can expand its capabilities almost effortlessly to meet growing demands without
            increasing staff or capital expenditures.</p>
        <li><b>Price-performance and cost savings</b></li>
        <p>Although an initial financial investment is required to implement a cloud strategy, organizations save
            substantial amounts in the long run because they don’t have to maintain expensive hardware or local data
            centers. Also, since there are no upfront costs to use cloud-based systems, businesses can test them out
            before investing in them at their own pace. Oracle provides price-performance and flexible sizing.</p>
        <li><b>Quick application deployment</b></li>
        <p>Unpredictable business needs often require cloud computing resources on short notice. You can improve your
            cloud application development by quickly deploying cloud applications because they are readily available
            without the need to procure additional hardware or wait for IT staff to set up servers. In addition you can
            choose from a broad range of services that support different types of cloud infrastructure technologies.</p>
        <li><b>bility to get rid of most or all hardware and software</b></li>
        <p>With cloud computing, you’re no longer required to have your own server, cables, network switches, backup
            generators, redundant routers, and so on. Depending on the cloud provider you choose, they can manage all of
            this for a monthly fee. Reducing expenses is essential in any business model and every cloud-based platform
            benefits from this factor alone.</p>

    <div class="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <img src="d:\Mangiliman_CET102\Horoscope\Advantages-of-Cloud-Computing.jpg" alt="advantages" id="image-left">
        <li><b>Data Backup and Restoration:</b>:</li>
        <p>Cloud computing offers a quick and easy method for data backup and restoration. Businesses may simply access
            and restore their data in the event of any data loss or system failure by keeping it in the cloud.</p>
        <li><b>Improved Collaboration:</b></li>
        <p>Collaboration is improved because cloud technologies make it possible for teams to share information easily.
            Multiple users may work together on documents, projects, and data thanks to shared storage in the cloud,
            enhancing productivity and teamwork.</p>
        <li><b>Excellent Accessibility:</b></li>
        <p>Access to information stored in the cloud is made possible. Users can access their data from anywhere in the
            world with an internet connection, making remote work, flexibility, and effective operations possible.</p>
        <li><b>Cost-effective Maintenance:</b></li>
        <p>Organizations using cloud computing can save money on both hardware and software upkeep. Because cloud
            service providers manage the maintenance and updates, businesses no longer need to make costly
            infrastructure investments or set aside resources for continuous maintenance.</p>
        <li><b>Upkeep and Updates:</b></li>
        <p>Cloud service providers take care of infrastructure upkeep, security patches, and updates, freeing
            organizations from having to handle these duties themselves.</p>

    <div class="disdvantages">
        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <img src="d:\Mangiliman_CET102\Horoscope\Disadvantages of Cloud Computing (1).jpg" alt="disadvantages" id="image-right">
        <li><b>Vendor Reliability and Downtime:</b></li>
        <p>Because of technological difficulties, maintenance needs, or even cyberattacks, cloud service providers can
            face outages or downtime. Users may not be able to access their data or applications during these times,
            which can interfere with business operations and productivity.</p>
        <li><b>Internet Dependency:</b></li>
        <p>A dependable and fast internet connection is essential for cloud computing. Business operations may be
            delayed or interrupted if there are connectivity problems or interruptions in the internet service that
            affect access to cloud services and data.</p>
        <li><b>Limited Control and Customization:</b></li>
        <p>Using standardized services and platforms offered by the cloud service provider is a common part of cloud computing. As a result, organizations may have less ability to customize and control their infrastructure, applications, and security measures. It may be difficult for some organizations to modify cloud services to precisely match their needs if they have special requirements or compliance requirements.</p>
        <li><b>Data Security and Concerns about Privacy:</b></li>
        <p>Concerns about data security and privacy arise when sensitive data is stored on the cloud. Businesses must have faith in the cloud service provider's security procedures, data encryption, access controls, and regulatory compliance. Unauthorized access to data or data breaches can have serious repercussions, including financial loss, reputational harm, and legal obligations.</p>
        <li><b>Hidden Costs and Pricing Models:</b></li>
        <p>Although pay-as-you-go models and lower upfront costs make cloud computing more affordable, businesses should be wary of hidden charges. Data transfer fees, additional storage costs, fees for specialized support or technical assistance, and expenses related to regulatory compliance are a few examples.</p>
